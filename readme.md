# Edmodo Coding Challenge
With the Edmodo Coding Challenge, a single page needed to be made to show the current assignments, and the submissions for each of these assignments. To create this project, I used ReactJS as my front end framework of choice, while using Redux to handle the application states. Using ReactJS, I was able to create the app utilizing several components, which would make API calls through actions, where Redux would take the data and put it into a store. Then the ReactJS components would pull the data from the Redux store and render it to the browser.

For the styling, I used react-bootstrap which allowed me to use Bootstrap style components by importing them into the React components. Any custom styling was applied by supplying CSS styles inside the respective components, and this allowed me to do so without making an external stylesheet. This method is also a good way to make styles explicitly apply to one component without affecting other components in the project.
